## AKAN NAME
### AN APPLICATION THAT DERIVES THE GHANA'S WAY OF NAMING CHILDREN USING DAY; AKAN NAME, April 2021
#### By Kiptoo Rotich
## Description
Sometimes people may forget the day of the week that they were born. But Ghana has a cultural way of naming their children using the day that they were born. Every day of the week has a different name for male and female children. This application takes user details and uses the details to calculate the day of the week and displays the day of the week that he/she was born and also their akan names. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Open terminal
* Change directory to the location you want to copy the project to.
* Clone the repo {git clone https://github.com/rotich1/akan-name }
* Now you have the project in your local machine
## Behaviour Driven Development
The application: 
* Allows users to input the details i.e name, gender and date of birth.
* If there is no input from user, the application alerts the user to provide the missing values.
* Checks the inputs and validates if they are correct.
* If inputs are invalid, the application gives an alert message to the user.
* Else if inputs are correct, the application evaluates the day of the week and uses the result to derive the akan name based on the formula output and gender.
